    <!--<section> is a semantic tag, meaning it indicates that the content inside belongs to a specific section of the page. It's used when the content has a thematic meaning (like a section for "Benefits of Journaling" or "Journal Prompts").
    <div> is a generic container used when we just need to group elements together for styling but the content itself doesn't necessarily have a specific meaning.
     In simple terms:
    Use <section> when the content belongs to a specific topic or purpose.
    Use <div> when you just need a container for styling or layout without adding meaning.-->
